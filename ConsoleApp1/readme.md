# Console 1

The idea hear is to create a simple math game that will show an equation and you have to solve it in a matter of seconds.
If you answer wrong or don't answer it in enough time, the game will end. After the game ends the data about the equation,
your answer, and the actual answer will be stored in a json file. And when you start the game up again you should be able 
to view the highscore of your previous games, and play again in order to see if you can beat your record.
